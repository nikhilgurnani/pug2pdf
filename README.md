# pug2pdf

##### This is unofficial library that combines the power of two packages [pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug) and [pdfshift](https://pdfshift.io) to generate a PDF from a Pug file.

### Set-up:

Download the NPM module
```
npm install pug2pdf --save
```

## USAGE GUIDE

### INITIALISE

Initialize with your [PDF Shift](https://pdfshift.io) auth key
```javascript
const pug2pdf = require('pug2pdf')('XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX');
```
That's all, you are ready to use PDF Shift service!

### Usage

You can now use the object to convert a pug file to a pdf. Simply pass the absolute path of the pug file with the data.

```javascript
pug2pdf( {

    pugPath: 'template.pug',

    data: { name: 'foo', address: 'bar'}

} );
```
pugPath can also contain a URL
```javascript
pug2pdf( {

    pugPath: 'http://foobar.com/template.pug',

    data: { name: 'foo', address: 'bar'}

} );
```
